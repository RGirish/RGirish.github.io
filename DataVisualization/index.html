            <p>
                Our project is a visual analytics on the Stackoverflow Java dataset. Basically, what we have build is a visual comparison tool that can be used to compare 2 or more different correlation algorithms. In the context of our dataset, what correlation means is how closely or loosely 2 different tags are connected. For instance, Android and XML are 2 tags that are very closely related, but Android and Spring might not be as related as Android and XML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our tool places visualizations like Chord diagrams and Network visualizations side by side to compare the difference in the algorithms employed. The first algorithm that we have used is basic Text Mining (done in R). The second algorithm is something that we came up with ourselves. It basically goes like this: <i>‘If a user has contributed a lot to 2 different tags, then they’re probably very related to each other’</i>. So, according to this algorithm, if 2 tags are shown as highly related, then they have a lot of common users who have contributed to these 2 tags.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, we can replace these 2 algorithms with anything that can produce a correlation matrix between tags. This makes the tool customizable and dynamic.

            <h3 style="color: #63A8B0">Research Questions we have tried to answer:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can the correlation between tags be analyzed from novel perspective apart from the traditional text mining algorithm?</li>
                <li>Can we successfully model the correlation between tags using a new promising approach? </li>
                <li>How tags are analyzed across different correlation algorithms ? How close are the tags interrelated with each other and how are they clustered differently? </li>
                <li>Can we model a correlation between popular tags based on users’ contribution activities in Stack Overflow?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #63A8B0">Methodology:</h3>
            <p>
                <b>User Correlation Algorithm</b> - This algorithm essentially frames the correlation matrix by analyzing the user interaction on various tags. The reason for choosing this algorithm is because a user always plays a vital role in any question and answer website. As per this algorithm, two tags A and B are said to be highly correlated if the two tags have a number of users in common. This commonality is obtained by running queries across various tags in the MySQL database.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>R Text Mining (TM) Algorithm</b> - This was the second algorithm used to find highly correlated tags and their relationship with other tags. A correlation matrix was constructed between the tags to find the highly correlated tag K-means clustering was used to cluster tags based on the value of the correlation coefficient and the correlation was represented as edge between two tags using the Euclidean distance value.

                <li>A highly positive correlation was recorded between the eclipse and android.</li>
                <li>Surprisingly android, arrays and regex were the most popular java tags.</li>
                <li>Network visualization was effective in finding the closely related tags through clustering while chord diagram exhibited dependency among tags.</li>
